This project is a comprehensive checklist management system based on nuclear safety standards such as IAEA-TECDOC-1848, SSG-39, and IEC 61513. Its primary goal is to simplify, standardize, and digitize safety assessments for instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants.

Key Features and Objectives
    - Centralized Data Management: Gathers requirements from various safety standards into a single, centralized platform.
    
    -  User-Friendly Interface: Allows engineers and inspectors to easily search, filter, and manage checklist items.
    
    - Visual Analytics: Visualizes project progress and compliance status through interactive charts and dashboards.
    
    -  RESTful API: Provides a RESTful API for seamless data integration with external systems and applications.
    
    - Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency by managing data addition, updates, and versioning processes.

Technology Stack
The project is built on a modern and scalable architecture:

    - Backend: Python (FastAPI) for a high-performance, asynchronous, and self-documenting API service.
    
    - Frontend: React.js + Vite for a component-based, high-performance, and fast development environment.
    
    - Database: SQLite for lightweight development and PostgreSQL for a robust, scalable production environment.
    
    - UI/UX: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for rapid and flexible styling, providing modern and highly customizable components.
    
    - Data Visualization: Recharts, a modular and composable charting library that is fully compatible with React.
    
    - Deployment: Docker to package the application and its dependencies into isolated containers for a consistent runtime environment.
    
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, accelerating the development lifecycle.

This guide provides a detailed roadmap for developing the project's backend and frontend, including Docker containerization and CI/CD automation.
